# MuScriptor

MuScriptor is a multi-instrument music transcription model developed by [Kyutai](https://kyutai.org) and [Mirelo](https://www.mirelo.ai).
MuScriptor is the first music transcription model that has been trained on a large scale dataset of 170k songs from classical music to heavy metal.

## HuggingFace login (required)

The model weights are hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/MuScriptor)
and gated behind their CC BY-NC 4.0 license, so downloading them — including
on the first `uvx muscriptor` run — requires a (free) HuggingFace account:

1. Accept the model license on the model page, e.g.
   [muscriptor-medium](https://huggingface.co/MuScriptor/muscriptor-medium)
   (access is granted automatically).
2. Authenticate on your machine:

   ```bash
   uvx hf auth login
   ```

   or set a token (create one at
   [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)):

   ```bash
   export HF_TOKEN=hf_...
   ```

The weights are then downloaded on first use and cached locally.

## Try it locally

You can try it locally with the web UI with:

```bash
uvx muscriptor serve
```

On windows, the default PyTorch backend is `cpu`, so to use the GPU on Windows, you'll need to run:

```bash
uvx --torch-backend=cu128 muscriptor serve
```
Use the `--torch-backend=cu128` flag every time you run a `uvx` command on Windows.

or with the CLI:

```bash
uvx muscriptor transcribe
```  

> **Intel Macs:** PyTorch stopped shipping Intel-mac (x86_64) wheels after
> torch 2.2.2, which supports Python ≤ 3.12, so you must tell uvx to use
> Python 3.12:
>
> ```bash
> uvx --python 3.12 muscriptor serve
> ```
>
> If you install with pip/uv instead, use Python 3.10–3.12.


## Installation

with uv (recommended):

```bash
uv add muscriptor
```

```bash
pip install muscriptor
```

## Models

Three variants are published under the [MuScriptor](https://huggingface.co/MuScriptor)
HuggingFace organization. Everywhere a model is selected (`load_model()`, the
CLI's `--model`, `serve --model`) you can pass the bare size keyword and the
weights are downloaded and cached automatically. The architecture is a transformer decoder only. Here are the detailed model sizes:

| Variant | Parameters | Layers | Dim | HuggingFace repo |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `small` | 103M | 14 | 768 | [muscriptor-small](https://huggingface.co/MuScriptor/muscriptor-small) |
| `medium` (default) | 307M | 24 | 1024 | [muscriptor-medium](https://huggingface.co/MuScriptor/muscriptor-medium) |
| `large` | 1.4B | 48 | 1536 | [muscriptor-large](https://huggingface.co/MuScriptor/muscriptor-large) |

`small` is the practical choice on CPU-only machines, `medium` is the default
speed/accuracy trade-off, and `large` is the most accurate but really wants a
GPU. On Apple Silicon the model runs on Metal (MPS) automatically, in float16
by default (`--dtype float32` to override) — fast enough that `large`
transcribes several times faster than real time. 
## Usage

```python
from pathlib import Path
from muscriptor import TranscriptionModel

# Downloads the default "medium" variant from HuggingFace (cached under
# ~/.cache/muscriptor/). Also accepts "small"/"large", a local safetensors
# path, or an hf:// / http(s):// URL.
model = TranscriptionModel.load_model()

# Stream events as they're transcribed. Optionally tell the model which
# instruments to expect — run `muscriptor list-instruments` for the names.
for event in model.transcribe("audio.wav", instruments=["acoustic_piano", "drums"]):
    print(event)

# Or get a MIDI file directly
midi_bytes = model.transcribe_to_midi("audio.wav")
Path("out.mid").write_bytes(midi_bytes)
```

        """Transcribe audio into a stream of note events.

        Args:
            audio: Path to an audio file, or a tuple `(tensor, sample_rate)`
                with a float tensor of shape [T] or [1, T] at `sample_rate`
                Hz. The tuple form is useful when the audio is already
                loaded in memory.
            use_sampling: Use temperature sampling instead of greedy decoding.
            temperature: Sampling temperature (only used when use_sampling=True).
            cfg_coef: Classifier-free guidance coefficient. Keep to 1 for the released models (they are post-RL)
            instruments: Optional list of instrument group names to
                restrict decoding to (exact names, e.g.
                ["acoustic_piano", "drums"]). Run `muscriptor
                list-instruments` (or GET /instruments on the server)
                for the full list of valid names. When given, this is a
                hard constraint: every program/drum token outside the
                list is masked out during generation, so no unlisted
                instrument can appear in the output. Leave unset to let
                the model decode whatever instruments it detects.
            batch_size: Number of 5-second model windows processed per forward
                pass. Each window contributes only its non-overlapping
                4-second core to the final MIDI; the surrounding 0.5 seconds
                on each side provide context. `None` (default) resolves to 1
                while prelude forcing is on; with
                `prelude_forcing=False` it picks 1 on CPU or 4 on GPU.
                Values > 1 require `prelude_forcing=False` and delay
                streaming: events from later chunks do not arrive until the
                whole batch finishes. Events remain in temporal chunk order.
            no_eos_is_ok: If True, a chunk that doesn't emit EOS within
                the generation budget produces a warning instead of raising.
            beam_size: Beam search width. 1 (default) uses greedy decoding
                (or sampling, with use_sampling=True); >= 2 enables beam
                search, which is slower but can be more accurate.
            prelude_forcing: If True (default), every chunk after the first
                has its tie prologue — the tokens declaring which notes are
                sustained from the previous chunk — teacher-forced from the
                previous chunk's actually-unfinished notes, instead of
                letting the model guess (which occasionally makes a chunk
                restart with the wrong instruments). Requires chunks to be
                generated strictly in order, so it only works with
                batch_size=1 (the default); set prelude_forcing=False
                explicitly to use larger batches.

        Returns:
            Generator of NoteStartEvent, NoteEndEvent and ProgressEvent
            objects. Every
            NoteStartEvent is guaranteed to be followed by exactly one
            matching NoteEndEvent later in the stream (with the same
            `index`). Drum hits appear as a NoteStartEvent immediately
            followed by its matching NoteEndEvent at the same start time
            plus a tiny duration. Note: this tokenizer does not preserve
            velocity (loudness) — only onset/offset timing, pitch, and
            instrument are recovered.

# Transcribe to MIDI (defaults to <audio_file>.mid next to the input)
muscriptor transcribe audio.wav -o out.mid

# Pick a model variant: small / medium / large (default: medium),
# a local safetensors path, or an hf:// / http(s):// URL
muscriptor transcribe audio.wav --model large

# Restrict decoding to only the instruments listed (comma-separated names;
# run `muscriptor list-instruments` for the full list). Case-insensitive,
# and unambiguous abbreviations work: 'timp,dist' = timpani + distorted
# electric guitar. Every other instrument's tokens are masked out during
# generation, so nothing else can appear in the output.
muscriptor transcribe audio.wav --instruments acoustic_piano,drums

# Get the event stream instead of MIDI: json (single array) or
# jsonl (one event per line, streamed while transcribing); -o - = stdout
muscriptor transcribe audio.wav --format jsonl -o -

# Decoding options: temperature sampling, or beam search (slower, can be
# more accurate)
muscriptor transcribe audio.wav --sampling -t 0.8
muscriptor transcribe audio.wav --beam-size 4

# Notes sustained across a chunk boundary are teacher-forced into the next
# chunk's prologue by default, so a chunk can't restart them with the wrong
# instrument. This needs chunks generated in order, so the batch size
# defaults to 1; batching (faster on GPU, lower quality at chunk boundaries)
# must be opted into explicitly:
muscriptor transcribe audio.wav --no-prelude-forcing --batch-size 4

# Render a stereo check-mix of the result (left channel = original audio,
# right channel = synthesized MIDI; requires fluidsynth on PATH)
muscriptor transcribe audio.wav -o out.mid --auralize check.wav
```

See `muscriptor transcribe --help` for the full list of options.

## Web UI

A browser client is included under `web/`. The FastAPI server serves both
the UI and a POST `/transcribe` endpoint that streams `NoteStart`/`NoteEnd`
events back as Server-Sent Events. The UI accepts an audio file (WAV, or any
format soundfile/libsndfile can read — mp3, flac, ogg, m4a, …) via drag-and-drop,
renders a live piano roll while events arrive, auto-plays once enough notes
are available, and crossfades between the original WAV and the synthesized
MIDI playback.

### One-time setup

```bash
uv sync
cd web && pnpm install && pnpm run build && cd ..
```

`pnpm run build` is required once — it outputs to `muscriptor/web_dist/`,
which the FastAPI server auto-mounts if it exists (and which ships inside
the PyPI wheel, so `uvx muscriptor serve` works without a checkout).

The soundfonts are not bundled: the server fetches
`MuseScore_General.sf2` (215 MB, used by `/auralize`) and
`MuseScore_General.sf3` (38 MB, the compressed build the UI plays) from
[MuScriptor/assets](https://huggingface.co/MuScriptor/assets) on first use
and caches them locally (see `muscriptor/soundfonts.py`).

### Run

```bash
uv run muscriptor serve \
    --model medium \
    --device cuda \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 8222
```

`--model` accepts a size keyword (`small`, `medium`, `large`) that downloads
the matching variant from HuggingFace (cached under `~/.cache/muscriptor/`),
a local safetensors path, or an `hf://` / `http(s)://` URL. It defaults to
`medium` when omitted.

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8222/> (or the LAN address of the host) and drop
a WAV onto the page.

- Drop `--device cuda` if running CPU-only.
- `--host 0.0.0.0` makes it reachable on the LAN; the default `127.0.0.1`
  is local-only.
- Playback runs a full SoundFont synthesizer ([SpessaSynth](https://github.com/spessasus/spessasynth_lib))
  in the browser, fed with `MuseScore_General.sf3` — the same soundfont the
  `/auralize` endpoint uses, served by the app itself from `/soundfonts/`
  (cached server-side), no third-party CDN.
